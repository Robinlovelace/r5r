#' @param origins,destinations Either a `POINT sf` object with WGS84 CRS, or a
#'   `data.frame` containing the columns `id`, `lon` and `lat`.
#' @param mode A character vector. The transport modes allowed for access,
#'   transfer and vehicle legs of the trips. Defaults to `WALK`. Please see
#'   details for other options.
#' @param mode_egress A character vector. The transport mode used after egress
#'   from the last public transport. It can be either `WALK`, `BICYCLE` or
#'   `CAR`. Defaults to `WALK`. Ignored when public transport is not used.
#' @param departure_datetime A POSIXct object. Please note that the departure
#'   time only influences public transport legs. When working with public
#'   transport networks, please check the `calendar.txt` within your GTFS feeds
#'   for valid dates. Please see details for further information on how
#'   datetimes are parsed.
#' @param max_walk_dist An integer. The maximum walking distance (in meters) to
#'   access and egress the transit network, or to make transfers within the
#'   network. Defaults to no restrictions, as long as `max_trip_duration` is
#'   respected. The max distance is considered separately for each leg (e.g. if
#'   you set `max_walk_dist` to 1000, you could potentially walk up to 1 km to
#'   reach transit, and up to _another_ 1 km to reach the destination after
#'   leaving transit). Please note that this parameter doesn't affect the
#'   maximum length of walking-only trips, only walking access, egress and
#'   transfer legs. If you want to set a maximum walking distance for
#'   walking-only trips you have to use the `max_trip_duration` parameter (e.g.
#'   to set a walking-only trip max distance of 1 km, assuming a walking speed
#'   of 3.6 km/h, you have to set `max_trip_duration = 1 / 3.6 * 60`).
#' @param max_bike_dist An integer. The maximum cycling distance (in meters) to
#'   access and egress the transit network, or to make transfers within the
#'   network. Defaults to no restrictions, as long as `max_trip_duration` is
#'   respected. The max distance is considered separately for each leg (e.g. if
#'   you set `max_bike_dist` to 1000, you could potentially cycle up to 1 km to
#'   reach transit, and up to _another_ 1 km to reach the destination after
#'   leaving transit). Please note that this parameter doesn't affect the
#'   maximum length of cycling-only trips, only cycling access, egress and
#'   transfer legs. If you want to set a maximum cycling distance for
#'   cycling-only trips you have to use the `max_trip_duration` parameter (e.g.
#'   to set a walking-only trip max distance of 5 km, assuming a cycling speed
#'   of 12 km/h, you have to set `max_trip_duration = 5 / 12 * 60`).
#' @param max_trip_duration An integer. The maximum trip duration in minutes.
#'   Defaults to 120 minutes (2 hours).
#' @param walk_speed A numeric. Average walk speed in km/h. Defaults to 3.6
#'   km/h.
#' @param bike_speed A numeric. Average cycling speed in km/h. Defaults to 12
#'   km/h.
#' @param max_rides An integer. The maximum number of public transport rides
#'   allowed in the same trip. Defaults to 3.
#' @param max_lts An integer between 1 and 4. The maximum level of traffic
#'   stress that cyclists will tolerate. A value of 1 means cyclists will only
#'   travel through the quietest streets, while a value of 4 indicates cyclists
#'   can travel through any road. Defaults to 2. Please see details for more
#'   information.
#' @param n_threads An integer. The number of threads to use when running the
#'   router in parallel. Defaults to use all available threads (Inf).
#' @param progress A logical. Whether to show a progress counter when running
#'   the router. Defaults to `FALSE`. Only works when `verbose` is set to
#'   `FALSE`, so the progress counter does not interfere with `R5`'s output
#'   messages. Setting `progress` to `TRUE` may impose a small penalty for
#'   computation efficiency, because the progress counter must be synchronized
#'   among all active threads.
#' @param output_dir Either `NULL` or a path to an existing directory. When not
#'   `NULL` (the default), the function will write one `.csv` file with the
#'   results for each origin in the specified directory. In such case, the
#'   function returns the path specified in this parameter. This parameter is
#'   particularly useful when running estimates on memory-constrained settings,
#'   because writing the results to disk prevents `r5r` from storing them in
#'   memory.

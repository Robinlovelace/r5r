#' @param time_window An integer. The time window in minutes for which `r5r`
#'   will calculate multiple travel time matrices departing each minute.
#'   Defaults to 1 minute. This parameter only affects the results when the
#'   GTFS feeds contain a `frequencies.txt` table. Please read the time window
#'   vignette for more details on its usage:
#'   `vignette("time_window", package = "r5r")`
#' @param draws_per_minute An integer. The number of Monte Carlo draws to
#'   perform per time window minute when calculating travel time matrices and
#'   when estimating accessibility. Defaults to 5. This would mean 300 draws in
#'   a 60 minutes time window, for example.
